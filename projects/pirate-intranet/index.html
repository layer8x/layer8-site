<p>
  Codename Pirate Intranet is a project to build a reliable, scalable, and secure private meshnet for running distributed intranet applications. We are still in the planning phases of development but this is what we have so far.
</p>

<p>
  We have chosen Ubiquiti and MikroTik to provide the necessary networking equipment, due to flexibility and pricing.<br>

  We aren't sure which antenas will be used, but we plan on purchasing a few NanoBeams for initial testing.
